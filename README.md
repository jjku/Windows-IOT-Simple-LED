Windows-IOT-Simple-LED

Just a very simple program to teach myself the basics of Windows IOT and the Raspberry Pi 3.
I am learning about C#/Visual Studio/Windows IOT and although there are a lot of resources out there, nothing that I found seem to help me pull everything together. It seemed a lot easier to just use Python, but I really wanted to learn Visual Studio and use Windows IOT. Some questions, to me, just never get answered, which left me in the dust.
This documentation is simply for myself and anyone else that is stuck in a lot of areas like myself.
