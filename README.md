Windows-IOT-Simple-LED

Just a very simple program to teach myself the basics of Windows IOT and the Raspberry Pi 3.
I am learning about C#/Visual Studio/Windows IOT and although there are a lot of resources out there, nothing that I found seem to help me pull everything together. It seemed a lot easier to just use Python, but I really wanted to learn Visual Studio and use Windows IOT. Some questions, to me, just never get answered, which left me in the dust.
This documentation is simply for myself and anyone else that is stuck in a lot of areas like myself.

To start:

You need:

Raspberry Pi 2 or 3
Windows IOT loaded on the Pi
Visual Studio
LED light - optional resistor

Step 1: Download the code, and build
Step 2: Plug the LED into the GPIO PIN 4 and the 3.3V header
Step 3: Run the program (make sure you pick ARM and Remote Machine in Visual Studio)
Step 4: The buttons on the screen should turn the LED light on and off
